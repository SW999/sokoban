# Sokoban

Unfinished game (*creepy code*) based on Sokoban

It was made in *2014* just for fun. There is only one level

## Controls

Use the arrows to control and space to undo the move.

## Legend

You are the Effective Manager and you have to make lazy programmers work.

Arrange them at workplaces, but be careful, some of them so soft that they can die at work! ))
